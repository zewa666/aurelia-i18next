# Moved

This repo has been moved to an official Aurelia repository which you can find here: [https://github.com/aurelia/i18n](https://github.com/aurelia/i18n).
All further development will be done over there.

Thanks for the help and contributions and if you like the work hop over to the official repo and give a GitHub star
